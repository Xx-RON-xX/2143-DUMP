## P01 - Fraction Class
### Ronald Cooper Ricketts
### Description:

Given the fraction class written during lecture here or using the provided code below (or both), 
create a proper fraction class that will overload the +, -, *, /, and == operators. Although I
write classes 1inline during lecture, I prefer (or mandate ... whatever makes you feel better) 
a class definition along with a class implementation where the definition has no variable names 
or implementation and the implementation is done outside of the definition using the scope 
resolution operator :: to bind methods to the Fraction class. We will also discuss the need for 
public and private methods.
